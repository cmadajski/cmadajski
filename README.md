# Salutations, Internet Traveler!

My name is **Christian Madajski** and I have experience working with the following technologies:

- building and consuming REST APIs
- lots of back end development
- a small amount of front end development
- automation systems and CI/CD pipelines

I have a **B.S. in Computer Science** with a minor in **Mathematics** from the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/). I graduated from that program in May 2022.

I have a new portfolio website, but it's still under construction.

I'm also active on [social media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmadajsk/).
