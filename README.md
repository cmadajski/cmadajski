Howdy internet traveler,

This is the GitHub of Christian Madajski.
I'm a computer science student at UNC Charlotte (graduating May 2022 ðŸ¥³).

Here you can see a selection of some of my programming explorations. This profile is
relatively new since my main account used my school email, and I wanted to start 
an account that will be accessible after I graduate.
